## Verticality

I remember one of my good friends in elementary school telling me that she blogged because 50 years down the road, she wanted to look back and remember all the good times and the bad. I guess it was like an online journal. Back then, blogging was new and fancy and everyone was discovering internet culture. I never understood the appeal, even after trying multiple times, online and offline.

I guess now I do, after typing this out. Back then, I was trying to make a blog to impress other people. It was a backwards way of thinking.

So cheers to new beginnings. The Blog section will be to showcase thoughts, papers, and ideas; the Post-Mortem section will be to go over the projects I've done and what I've taken away from them.
