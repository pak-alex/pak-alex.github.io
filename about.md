Alexander Pak - Data Scientist
{:.lead}

Data is everywhere, but that does not mean it is accessible. Interpreting and transforming data into relatable insights is my passion. Master of Data Science graduate from the University of British Columbia, with data analyst and data science experience working in healthcare fields. I enjoy the challenge of designing and optimizing machine learning models to be the absolute best they can be, and I firmly believe that the potential of data should be used to do good in the world.

Initially, with my Biophysics undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to work in several hospital and research labs. Working with the cutting edge of science was an eye-opening experience; there were no textbooks or procedures to follow when you were the one writing them. It was in the lab that I realized my passion for data science. Having all the data in the world does not matter if you cannot interpret the results, which pushed me to pursue a Master's Degree in Data Science at the University of British Columbia.

I have had the opportunity to build a content-based filtering recommender system for QxMD, a mobile healthcare platform bringing the latest medical news to its users. Presently, I am working with a consulting company to optimize and automate data intake, cutting down hours of work to just seconds. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a Data Scientist and to be part of a motivated team that truly wants to make a positive difference through their work.
